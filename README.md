# 02Zcat By: @Killerpop


02Zcat is a formidable tool for the creation of undetectable 
backdoors developed in bash. In a scrtip that allows us 
o generate an executable file. 
The reverse way we can have a secure connection against a victim.
This tool also has an excellent module to listen to the host victim.
